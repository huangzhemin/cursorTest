    "date": "",
    "content": ".cursor/rules: Users can write several repository-level rules to disk in the .cursor/rules directory. The Agent will automatically choose which rule to follow.\nDeepseek models: Deepseek R1 and Deepseek v3 are supported in 0.45 and 0.44. You can enable them in Settings > Models. We self-host these models in the US.\nSummarize Previous Composers: When conversations grow too long, you can start a new conversation while referencing the previous one.\nAgent sees recent changes: The agent can use a tool to see your recent changes. It also sees changes made between user messages.\nBetter Codebase Understanding: We've trained a new model for Codebase Understanding. We'll be rolling it out to all users on 0.45 in the coming week.\nFusion Model: We've trained a new Tab Model that is substantially better at jumps and long context. We'll also be rolling this out to users shortly.\nOptional Long Context: When tagging long files, users have the option to request a larger context window with premium models. This will use more fast requests.\nUPDATE (0.45.1-0.45.8): Fixes issue with older agent conversations, indexing stability, downloading incorrect extension versions, missing package on windows, crash on opening long composer sessions, latency on pasting code.\nAlso adds MCP support, team-configurable blocklists, fixes Composer stuck on generating issue for some windows builds, and exit code 5 crashes."
