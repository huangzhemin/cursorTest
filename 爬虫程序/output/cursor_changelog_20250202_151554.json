It also sees changes made between user messages.\nBetter Codebase Understanding: We've trained a new model for Codebase Understanding. We'll be rolling it out to all users on 0.45 in the coming week.\nFusion Model: We've trained a new Tab Model that is substantially better at jumps and long context. We'll also be rolling this out to users shortly.\nOptional Long Context: When tagging long files, users have the option to request a larger context window with premium models. This will use more fast requests.\nUPDATE (0.45.1-0.45.8): Fixes issue with older agent conversations, indexing stability, downloading incorrect extension versions, missing package on windows, crash on opening long composer sessions, latency on pasting code.
